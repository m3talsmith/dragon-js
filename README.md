DragonJs
=========

A Client-side Javascript MVC Framework that brings that's actually easy to use and Restful by default.

Status
------

We're currently working on the various pieces of this framework in other repositories. The framework consists of:

* A [Restful Model](https://github.com/thedeepwoodsbrigade/restful-model)
* A Restful Controller
* Some decent views
* And Restful Routing

We'll be pulling the whole framework together once each component is at a 1.0 tag level with stable API's.
